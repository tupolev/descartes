Descartes: Multiformat image selection/discard wizard.

From an input directory, containing a list of files in different formats with same names 
(typically, the output of a DSLR camera in RAW + JPEG mode), 
assists the user to select and discard images for the next workflow phase or simply to
remove undesired captures.
This is done by a "lightbox" window running the full sequence of images, with five buttons:
Select / discard; Next/Prev and Abort.

At the end of the process, user is prompted to choose between separating the two file lists 
in two different folders, deleting the discards list or maybe more options I come up with :P

The i18n part will be done when the main functionality is achieved.

Platform: .net 4.0 (WPF with C#).

Any form of help will deserve a chilling beer in some close future :)
